Python is a high-level, interpreted, and general-purpose programming language known for its simplicity, readability, and versatility. It was created by Guido van Rossum in 1991. It has easy syntax (i.e., uses whitespace indentations instead of braces/parentheses to distinguish codes), and dynamic semantics (initializes variables as per requirement). It is called an interpreted language because it's compiled line-by-line, though it may be slower than other programming languages like C/C++, it's easier to debug errors.<br/>
### Key Features of Python include:<br/>
- Easy-to-read Syntax<br/>
  - Emphasize code readability<br/>
  - Uses whitespace indentation to define code blocks<br/>
- Interpreted language<br/>
  - Code is executed line-by-line by a Python interpreter without the need for a compiler.<br/>
- Dynamic Typing<br/>
  - No need to explicitly declare variable types.<br/>
  - The type of a variable is determined at runtime.<br/>
- Multi-paradigm<br/>
  - Supports multiple programming paradigms including procedural, obj-oriented, and functional programming.<br/>
- Large standard library<br/>
  - Offers a vast range of modules and packages for various tasks, from working with data to handling web requests.
- Community-driven<br/>
  - Large & active community that contributes to the language's growth & development.<br/>
  - Reason for many 3rd-party libraries & frameworks.<br/>
- Platform-independent<br/>
  - Runs on different platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux, etc.) without modification as long as a Python interpreter is available.<br/>
- Open-source<br/>
  - Source code is freely available.<br/>
